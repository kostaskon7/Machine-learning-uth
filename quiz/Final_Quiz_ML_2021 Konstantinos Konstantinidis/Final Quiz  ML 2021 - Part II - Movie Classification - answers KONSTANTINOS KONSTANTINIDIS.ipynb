    "`output = relu(dot(W, input) + b)`\n",
    "\n",
    "Having 16 hidden units means that the weight matrix `W` will have shape `(input_dimension, 16)`, i.e. the dot product with `W` will project the \n",

    "intuitively understand the dimensionality of your representation space as \"how much freedom you are allowing the network to have when \n",
    "learning internal representations\". Having more hidden units (a higher-dimensional representation space) allows your network to learn more \n",
    "complex representations, but it makes your network more computationally expensive and may lead to learning unwanted patterns (patterns that \n",

    "and a third layer which will output the scalar prediction regarding the sentiment of the current review. \n",

    "and the final layer will use a sigmoid activation so as to output a probability \n",
    "(a score between 0 and 1, indicating how likely the sample is to have the target \"1\", i.e. how likely the review is to be positive). \n",
    "A `relu` (rectified linear unit) is a function meant to zero-out negative values, \n",
